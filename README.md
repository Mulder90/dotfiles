# [Lorenzo Cinque](https://github.com/mulder90)’s dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that I use, started as fork of [Cătălin](https://github.com/alrra) dotfiles

## Setup

To set up the `dotfiles` just run the appropriate snippet in the
terminal:

`bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.github.com/mulder90/dotfiles/master/setup.sh)"`

That's it! :sparkles:

Setup process in action:

### Forks

username with your own.


## Update

To update the dotfiles you can either run the [`setup`
script](setup.sh) or, if you want to just update one particular part, run the appropriate script
